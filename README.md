# Frontend Practice Projects 🚀

This repository showcases my personal journey in learning frontend web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes small, self-contained projects that focus on improving layout, design, and interactivity skills.



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)



## 📂 Projects

- `01-todo-list/` — A simple to-do list app with add, complete, and delete functionality.
- `02-Portfolio/` - A simple portfolio with HTML, CSS and JS



## 📌 Notes

- Frontend-only projects (no backend).
- More mini-projects will be added as I learn.
