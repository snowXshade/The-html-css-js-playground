# The Frontend Learning Journey 🚀

This repository is a collection of my personal frontend experiments, practice projects, and mini-web apps. It serves as a portfolio and logbook as I improve my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.



## 🛠️ Technologies

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**



## 📂 Structure

This repo will evolve over time. Initially, I plan to include:

- `01-html-css-basics/` — Static pages to practice layout and design
- `02-responsive-design/` — Experiments with Flexbox, Grid, and media queries
- `03-javascript-fundamentals/` — Interactive UI components
- `04-mini-projects/` — Small frontend-only apps (like to-do, calculator, etc.)



## 📌 Notes

- This is a **frontend-only** repository.
- Backend development will be handled in a separate repository.
- The goal is consistent learning, experimentation, and growth.



## ✨ Upcoming

- Dark/light mode switcher
- CSS animations and transitions
- Single Page Apps with vanilla JS
